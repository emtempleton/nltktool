LaTeX Source for Close Reading Toolkit Chart

This repository contains the LaTeX source to build a PDF of the Close Reading
Toolkit, a tool for teaching close reading of literary texts to students. 

This chart was initially developed by Jed Dobson for the American Renaissance
MOOC that he taught with Donald E. Pease for DartmouthX on the edX platform in
the Winter of 2016.

The Close Reading Toolkit is released here under the MIT License.

NLTK Toolkit

This is a simple Python wrapper for the Natural Language Toolkit and
scikit-learn. It was written for use in the classroom to play with text mining
and topic modeling tools by examining an input file of "yaks" obtained from the
YikYak social media application.

# Examples

Viewing some basic information from input file:

    $ nltktool -f yaks-stripped.txt stats
    opening file: yaks-stripped.txt
    total number of lines: 3698
    total number of words: 56019
    total number of unique non-stop
    words: 5750
